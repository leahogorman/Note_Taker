## **Description**
For this project we were asked to create a note taker application that allows you to write and delete notes. It had to use express in the backend and save and retrieve data from a JSON file.

## **Elements**

For this project the front end was created for us. The goal was to create a server.js file that connected the frontend allowing you to create notes, delete notes, and see notes on reload.

In the server page we created a note list with a unique id for the first note. Then we created an app.delete command that, using splice, allowed you to delete the notes. For app post we created a new note with a new unique id using UUID.
